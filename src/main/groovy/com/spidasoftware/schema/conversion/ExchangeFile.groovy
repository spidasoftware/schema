/**
 *
 * Represents a .exchange.spida file and has methods for creating and opening them. Basically just takes care of
 * zipping the file and making sure contents are named correctly. There are static methods that can be used to easily
 * create instances of this class that are ready to be read or written.
 *
 * More precisely, this class represents a directory on the filesystem that contains all the makings of
 * an exchange file. The createFromZipFile method is just an easy way to unzip an exchange file to a
 * temp directory.
 *
 * The exchange file is simply a zip file, with the project json at it's root:
 * <pre>
 *     my-project.exchange.spida (root)
 *     +--- project.json
 *     +--- Photos
 *         \
 *         +--- photo1.jpg
 *         +--- photo2.jpg
 *         ...
 * </pre>
 * The project json should always be named "project.json", and the photos directory must always be named "Photos"
 * (capital P). The names of photos will be resolved relative to the Photos directory. So, if a Location has an image
 * with the url, "photo1.jpg", then the photo file would resolve to "Photos/photo1.jpg".
 * These files can be opened by using the normal open dialog.
